Stopwatch Project Design Document

1. Project Overview

The Stopwatch project is a simple web application built using React. It allows users to start, stop, reset a timer, and toggle between light and dark modes. The app aims to demonstrate fundamental React concepts, including state management, effects, and event handling.

2. Features

Start the stopwatch to count seconds.

Stop the stopwatch to pause counting.

Reset the stopwatch to set time to 0.

Toggle between light and dark mode for the interface.

3. Technology Stack

Frontend: React (Hooks: useState, useEffect)

Styling: CSS (App.css)

4. Component Breakdown

Stopwatch Component: Handles all UI and logic.

State Variables:

time: Tracks elapsed time in seconds.

isRunning: Boolean to control the timer.

darkMode: Boolean for theme mode.

Functions:

handleStart(): Starts the timer.

handleStop(): Pauses the timer.

handleReset(): Stops and resets the timer.

toggleDarkMode(): Switches the theme mode.

5. Application Workflow

Initialization:

The component loads with default state (time = 0, isRunning = false, darkMode = false).

Starting the Timer:

User clicks the 'Start' button.

handleStart() sets isRunning to true.

useEffect starts a timer using setInterval, updating time every second.

Stopping the Timer:

User clicks the 'Stop' button.

handleStop() sets isRunning to false.

The timer interval is cleared using clearInterval in useEffect.

Resetting the Timer:

User clicks the 'Reset' button.

handleReset() sets time to 0 and isRunning to false.

Ensures the timer is not running and the display shows '0s'.

Toggling Dark Mode:

User clicks 'Toggle Dark Mode' button.

toggleDarkMode() switches the darkMode state between true and false.

The CSS class for dark mode is applied dynamically.

6. Future Improvements

Add lap time functionality.

Implement a countdown timer mode.

Enhance UI with better animations and styles.

7. Design Considerations

Simple and minimalistic design.

Accessible color scheme for both light and dark modes.

Responsive layout to work on different screen sizes.
